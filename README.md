# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The app developed is an inventory tracking application. It was designed to authenticate an end user using a user ID and password to ensure only authorized edits take place. It is designed to add, remove, increase, and decrease items added into a database. The application can send an alert to a user if the stock drops low via a radio button on the setting menu of the app. The inventory is organized into a grid view. 

# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The application uses four screens including a login, grid view display of inventory, settings and notifications, and an add items flow. In order to keep the user in mind while developing the UI, the screens in the application use a variety of green and blue colors to stay within the theme and each screen flows to one another without being confusing or misleading. This application worked well as I followed along and ensured that I followed the android core application quality document.

# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
To code this application, I had big ambitions to start and tried adding too many features in. This slowed the process and ultimately ended in a poor application as I had more features but a non-functional application. Moving forward from this, I started with a working application and then started implementing features such as the notification system and the menu. In the future, I know that I’ll need to start with a working app before adding features to it. 

# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
To ensure that my code was functional and running, I tested on different emulated devices in the Android IDK with different screen sizes such as different pixel devices and different tables. This is important as when developing an application, the developer may have one device in mind, but the end user may want to use the  application on a variety of different devices. 

# Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
Initially, I struggled with getting everything together. I had the notification screen set up, but couldn’t get it to flow with the menu and didn't really understand how to connect the radio button. I worked through some tutorials online and created the switch from there. 

# In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I believe I did well with creating the log in authentication screen. I’ve enjoyed the most working with SQL and its different flavors such as mySQL and noSQL and look forward to pairing different programming languages with database integration.
